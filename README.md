# switch-component
A switch form Web Component utilising the latest ES6 and other web technologies to create [reusable custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). While not explicitly extending the HTML checkbox element ([<input type="checkbox">](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox)) the underlying state management uses a standard checkbox in order to keep track of the "checked"\"unchecked" state and allow for a value to be sent via submissions<sup>[[1](#footnotes)]</sup>.

The component is reactive in size - the handle will grow/shrink with respect to the set width/height (which can be configured either via the width/height attributes or using CSS styling).   

Listeners are attached to work as other standard HTML elements of similar functionality. The click, spacebar and enter keyboard events (once having focus) will all change the state of the switch. 

Additionally all custom attributes also have the same named properties and are kept in sync for any Javascript manipulation.

## Installation
1. Add the `switch-component.js` file to your `/js` folder.

2. Include the javascript file into the page you're wanting to use it in. It's recommended *not* to use the _async_ keyword so that the file loads as soon as possible. 

`<script charset="utf-8" defer src="js/switch-component.js" type="module"></script>`

It is also recommended to include the **web components polyfill** for the older browsers unable to understand the new ES6 functions. 

```html
<!-- The web component polyfill -->
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/edf84e6e/webcomponents-sd-ce.js"></script>
```

## Usage
```html
  <cloud-switch
          name="cloudSwitch"
          value="1"
  ></cloud-switch> <!-- Minimum required code, additional attributes are defined below. -->
```
